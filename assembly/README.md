# Assembling Your Gopherbot Kit

Here are instructions on how to assemble your Gopherbot kit.

## Check Your Parts

Start by verifying that you have all your parts.

## Helmet - Visor

The helmet has a cool visor. In this step we will assemble it.

You will need a very small piece of tape to complete this step. The most permanent is to use a small bit of black duct tape. Other colors will also work, as you cannot see the tape from the outside of the helmet.

You can also use other tape, as long as it sticks to the PLA material used on the helmet.

Some of the tape that is known NOT to work well: electrical tape, gift wrapping tape, painters tape.

## Helmet - Antenna

Now that the visor is installed, it is time to attach the antenna to the helmet.

If you are going to want to remove and reattach the antenna, for example if you want to pack your Gopherbot for travel, you will need some electrical tape or tiny wire screws.

Otherwise, if you want leave the antenna permanently attached, you can use the red connectors that are included in your kit.

## Helmet - Ears and cables

Attach the ears, and then tie wrap the cables neatly to the helmet.

## Backpack

Last but not least, it is time to assemble the 3D printed backpack.
