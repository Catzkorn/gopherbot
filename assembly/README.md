# Assembling Your Gopherbot Kit

Here are instructions on how to assemble your Gopherbot kit.

## Preparation

### Check Your Parts

Start by verifying that you have all your parts. Take a look at the list of [kit parts](./KIT.md).

### Things You Need That Are Not In The Kit

There are several items you will need that are not included in the Gopherbot kit:

- 5V USB Battery
- Small piece of black duct tape (approx 40mm wide and 100mm in length)
- Normal size pliers or crimpers
- Small Phillips head screwdriver

## Assembly

### Helmet - Visor

The helmet has an LED-filled visor. In this section we will assemble it.

You will need the small piece of tape to complete this assembly. The most permanent solution is to use a small bit of black duct tape. Other colors will also work, as you cannot see the tape from the outside of the helmet.

You can also use other kinds of tape, as long as it sticks to the PLA material used on the helmet.

Some kinds of tape that are known NOT to work well: electrical tape, gift wrapping tape, painters tape.

- Attach 3-pin connector to LEDs

Attach the 3-pin connector to the strip of RGB LEDs.

- Attach 3-pin connector to ribbon cable

Crimp the wires on the 3-pin connector to the wires on the ribbon cable using the pliers.

- Attach ribbon cable to Circuit Playground Express

Attach ribbon cable to Circuit Playground Express using the fork connectors.

- Test the RGB LED strip

Run a test program to make sure that the LEDs are wired correctly.

- Disconnect ribbon cable from Circuit Playground Express

Disconnect the ribbon cable from the Circuit Playground Express for now to make it easier to finish putting the LEDs inside the helmet.

- Place gel strip inside visor

Place the gel strip inside the helmet in the small space inside the visor.

- Place LEDs inside visor

Place the LEDs on top of the gel strip from inside the helmet in the small space inside the visor.

- Tape down the LEDs/gel strip

Carefully use the duct tape to tape down the LEDs/gel strip to the inside of the helmet.

- Route the wires around the inside of the helmet

Route the wires around the inside of the helmet, but do not attach them to anything yet.

### Helmet - Antenna

Now that the visor is installed, it is time to attach the antenna to the helmet.

If you are going to want to remove and reattach the antenna, for example if you want to pack your Gopherbot for travel, you will need some electrical tape or tiny wire screws.

Otherwise, if you want leave the antenna permanently attached, you can use the red connectors that are included in your kit.

- Screw first locking washer onto spring

Screw one of the locking washers partway up the spring.

- Screw the spring into the top of the helmet

Screw the spring into the top of the helmet up to the locking washer.

- Screw second locking washer onto spring

Screw second locking washer onto spring from *inside the helmet*.

- Insert LED with resistor thru spring from top

Insert the LED with pre-wired resistor into the spring from the top, and carefully pull thru until the LED is even with the top of the spring. It does not need to be pulled very tight.

### Helmet - Ears and cables

Attach the ears, and then tie wrap the cables neatly to the helmet.

- Attach ears

- Route ribbon cable thru channel

- Use tie wraps to secure ribbon cable

### Backpack

Now it is time to assemble the 3D printed backpack.

- Cut nylon backpack straps

- Tie on nylon backpack straps

- Connect ribbon cable wires to A2 and A3

- Attach Circuit Playground Express to backpack

- Connect ribbon cable wires to 3.3V and GND

- Cut battery straps

- Tie on USB battery

### Putting on the helmet and backpack

You should now be ready to put the helmet and backpack on your plushie.
