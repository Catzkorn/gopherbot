Pull each tie wrap tight to hold the ribbon cable in place. You might need to slide the tie wrap to be able to tighten it down completely.

Once the tie wraps are tightened, cut off the ends.

## Attach ears

Slide the ears into the holes on the sides of the helmet. They will be snug, but should fit. Do not use too much force.

Now it is time to finish assembling the 3D printed backpack.
