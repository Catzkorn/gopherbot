# Helmet - Visor

The helmet has an LED-filled visor. In this section we will assemble it.

You will need the small piece of tape to complete this assembly. The most permanent solution is to use a small bit of black duct tape. Other colors will also work, as you cannot see the tape from the outside of the helmet.

You can also use other kinds of tape, as long as it sticks to the PLA material used on the helmet. For example, black electrical tape.

Some kinds of tape that are known NOT to work well: gift wrapping tape, painters tape.

## Attach ribbon cable to Circuit Playground Express

Attach ribbon cable to Circuit Playground Express using the fork connectors.

## Test the RGB LED strip

Run a test program to make sure that the LEDs are wired correctly.

## Disconnect ribbon cable from Circuit Playground Express

Disconnect the ribbon cable from the Circuit Playground Express for now to make it easier to finish putting the LEDs inside the helmet.

## Place gel strip inside visor

Place the gel strip inside the helmet in the small space inside the visor.

## Place LEDs inside visor

Place the LEDs on top of the gel strip from inside the helmet in the small space inside the visor.
